The US Department of Health and Human Services has announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will be releasing $631m to state and local governments in response to the COVID-19 health emergency.   Health Secretary Alex Azar said that the money will be awarded to 64 local governments to help states with their efforts to reopen, a controversial policy that has drawn criticism by the opposition and many health experts.
