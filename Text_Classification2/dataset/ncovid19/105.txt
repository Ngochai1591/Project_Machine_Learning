"TfL is to place 7,000 staff whose work has been reduced or paused as a result of the coronavirus pandemic on furlough from Monday. This will allow TfL to access funding from the Government's Job Retention Scheme, saving the organisation an estimated 15.8 million pounds every four weeks," TfL, which runs the city's Underground subway system and bus network, said in a statement.
