The PSOE, led by incumbent premier Susana Díaz, had been expected to win the early elections, but in a shock result the party took the most seats in parliament, 33, but fell well short of a majority of 55. It was their worst result in the region since Spain returned to democracy. The PP came in second, with 26 seats, while Ciudadanos were third with 21. The major surprise was the strong performance of far-right group Vox, which won more than 391,000 votes (10.9%), giving it 12 deputies. The anti-immigration group is the first of its kind to win seats in a Spanish parliament since the end of the Francisco Franco dictatorship. It now holds the key to power in Andalusia, given that its votes, added to those of the PP and Ciudadanos, constitute an absolute majority.\n",

Rather than align itself with the far right party, the group – which began life in Catalonia in response to the independence drive, but soon launched onto the national stage – had sought a deal with Adelante Andalucía.\n",

    "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also known as 2019-nCov or nCovid-19) outbreak has become a huge public health issue due to its rapid transmission making it a global pandemic. Currently, there are no vaccines or drugs available for nCovid-19, hence early detection is crucial to help and manage the outbreak. Here, we report an in-house built biosensor device (eCovSens) and compare it with a commercial potentiostat machine for the detection of nCovid-19 spike protein antigen (nCovid-19 Ag) in spiked saliva samples. A potentiostat based sensor was fabricated using fluorine doped tin oxide electrode (FTO) drop casted with gold nanoparticle (AuNPs) and immobilized with nCovid-19 monoclonal antibody (nCovid-19 Ab) to measure change in the electrical conductivity. Similarly, eCovSens was used to measure change in electrical conductivity by immobilizing nCovid-19 Ab on screen printed carbon electrode (SPCE). The performances of both sensors were recorded upon interaction of nCovid-19 Ab with its specific nCovid-19 Ag. Under optimum conditions, the FTO based immunosensor and proposed SPCE-based biosensor device displayed high sensitivity for early detection of nCovid-19 Ag, ranging from 1 fM to 1 uM. Our in-house developed eCovSens device can successfully detect nCovid-19 Ag at 10 fM concentration in standard buffer that is in close agreement with FTO/AuNPs sensor where AuNPs were used for the amplification of the electrical signal. The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 90 fM with eCovSens and 120 fM with potentiostst in case of spiked saliva samples. The proposed portable point of care (PoC) eCovSens device can be used as an alternative diagnostic tool for the rapid (within 10-30 s) detection of nCovid-19 Ag traces directly in patient saliva samples that displayed high sensitivity, stability, and specificity.\n",

    "This paper investigates how air temperature and humidity influence the transmission of COVID-19. After estimating the serial interval of COVID-19 from 105 pairs of the virus carrier and the infected, we calculate the daily effective reproductive number, R, for each of all 100 Chinese cities with more than 40 cases. Using the average R from January 21 to 23, 2020 as a proxy of non-intervened transmission intensity, we find, under a linear regression framework for 100 Chinese cities, high temperature and high relative humidity reduce the transmission of COVID-19 with a significance level of 1% and 5%, respectively, even after controlling for population density and GDP per capita of cities. One degree Celsius increase in temperature and one percent increase in relative humidity lower R by 0.0266 and 0.0106, respectively. This result is consistent with the fact that the high temperature and high humidity significantly reduce the transmission of influenza. It indicates that the arrival of summer and rainy season in the northern hemisphere can effectively reduce the transmission of the COVID-19.\n",
